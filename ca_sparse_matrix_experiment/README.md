# Cellular Automata Sparse Matrix Experiment

This experiment investigates the spectral properties of sparse matrices generated from the evolution of a 1D elementary cellular automaton.

## Hypothesis

The hypothesis is that sparse matrices generated by cellular automata exhibit unique spectral characteristics that are determined by the automaton's rule, and these characteristics are notably different from those of random sparse matrices with similar sparsity.

## Methodology

1.  A 1D elementary cellular automaton is simulated for a given rule (e.g., Rule 30), size, and number of steps.
2.  The history of the automaton's evolution is converted into a sparse matrix.
3.  A random sparse matrix is generated with the same dimensions and sparsity as the cellular automaton matrix.
4.  The eigenvalues of both matrices are computed.
5.  The distributions of the eigenvalues are plotted in a histogram for comparison.

## Results

The experiment was run with Rule 30, a grid size of 100, and 100 steps. The resulting eigenvalue distributions are shown below:

As the plot shows, the eigenvalue distribution for the matrix generated by the cellular automaton is significantly different from that of the random sparse matrix. The cellular automaton matrix has a more structured and less uniform distribution of eigenvalues, suggesting that the underlying deterministic rules of the automaton impose a distinct structure on the matrix's spectrum.

## Conclusion

The results support the hypothesis that cellular automata can generate sparse matrices with unique spectral properties. This could have interesting applications in areas where the spectral properties of matrices are important, such as graph theory, network analysis, and the initialization of neural network weights.
